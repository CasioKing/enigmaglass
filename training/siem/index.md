# Training Materials - What is SIEM?
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Manager
Real time analysis of security alerts / logs generated by applications and network hardware

SOAR stands for Security Orchestration Automation Response
Automated event response, ex. A rule might trigger when there are > 20 failed login attempts in a short amount of time, resulting in the IP being blocked automatically

UEBA stands for User and Event Behavioral Analytics
Compares real time network and application data to baselines to identify abnormalities

SIP stands for Security Intelligence Platform
Combines SIEM, SOAR, and UEBA
Manual log monitoring gets messy quickly. SIEM is meant to make it possible for companies to monitor logs that are generated from thousands of nodes in real time.

Required by data security policies, ex. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
â€œAudit logs must exist for all system components. Audit logs send alerts the system administrator, provides data to other monitoring mechanisms, such as intrusion-detection systems (IDS) and security information and event monitoring systems (SIEM) tools, and provide a history trail for post-incident investigation. Logging and analyzing security-relevant events enable an organization to identify and trace potentially malicious activities. (p. 215 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
